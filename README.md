# MasteryConnect Test #

## Objective ##
---

Part I.

Create a contact form that would be production-ready.
*The form should have the following fields:*
Name*, Email*, Subject (with 3 or more predefined options), and a textarea for a message(1000 characters max.)

Place all of your HTML in the #request_form section in the index.html file.

You may use jquery and jquery plug-ins, as well as any custom css and js you want. Please do not use front-end frameworks like foundation, etc.

Please create clean code and add any behaviors you think might make the page more visually interesting.

Do not worry about making any links work, or form(s) posting.


Part II.

Create a javascript class that validates the contact for data. It should validate the required fields (marked with asterisk above.)


Part III.

In a separate file, create a Ruby class. The class should have 2 methods, one that accepts a string as a param, and returns a hash.

The method will return each unique letter the string contains in order from most frequent to least frequent (in alphabetical order).

eg. if the input string is 'foo bar baz', the return should be {a=>2, b=>2, o=>2, f=>1, r=>1, z=>1}

Use the text 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Morbi tincidunt arcu eget lacus blandit efficitur' as the string parameter.

The second method will take an integer as a param and return an array of integers.

The method will compare each number from 0 to the param and return an array of numbers that are evenly divisible by 3 and/or 5.

eg. if the input integer is 10, the return should be [0,3,5,6,9,10]
